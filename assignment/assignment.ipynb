Tidy data provides a standard way to link the physical layout of the data to its meaning, whereas messy datasets all have different problems and different layouts that require custom approaches to analyze. It's hard to understand the relationships between variables and if they link to a specific observation, and different situations might call for different variables."

Table 4 is messy because variables form both rows and columns, and column names are values. Melting turns columns into rows.\n",

The chicken and egg problem with tidy data is that tidy data will always be linked to tidy tools, so there is the possibility of independently changing structure and data tools without improving workflow.
